# We're the McClatchy journalism AI innovation team

## And here's what we're up to.

We're a small group of journalists helping McClatchy's 30+ local newsrooms responsibly harness data, automation and artificial intelligence to elevate and strengthen their reporting.

This site, still a work in progress, is our growing repository of training, tutorials, reporting recipes and tool lists to help journalists find what theyâ€™re looking for amid the fast-moving world of AI.

Keep checking back for more updates. And if you have questions, reach out to the team at [journalismai@mcclatchy.com](mailto:journalismai@mcclatchy.com).
